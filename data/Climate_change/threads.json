costs of implementing the kyoto protocol in light of increasing fuel use efficiency both are about two pages and appear to be primarily tagreted toward a popular audience in my estimation my feeling is that they are not significant in the literature on climate change either from a scientific policy or pedogogic view while not bad themselves they don t to me represent the best resources which can be linked to for myself i would leave them out and have reverted their addition to bring it here for more discussion as per the hidden note on the article hi what about adding http www pewclimate org it looks like a solid set of resources and is certainly middle of the road politicall i have added a link the seldom heard counter arguement to the british channel 4 website specifically the page describing a documentary entitled the great global warming swindle which provides an entirely different school of thought on the subject of climate change it seems that any reading on the subject is set on spreading the word that carbon emissions are solely responible for our appartently impending doom this documentary opened my eyes not necessarily to say that everything we have come to believe is untrue but that this story like every story has two sides how a person can make a informed decision without seeing all the evidence is unknown to me and i suggest that everybody who has an opinion on the topic of climate change should research the ideas raised in this documentary if you haven t already i appreciate that the website is not presented in a formal scientific style however the link is provided as a starting point for further research and or discussion and i ve reverted it pov argumentation links doesn t belong here there is already an article about the great global warming swindle ok i appreciate that comment though i would like to suggest that the article itself is a point of view essentially one of many possible conclusions drawn from the evidence gained my reasoning for adding the link was to keep the article discurive a larger problem with tggws is that much of the data they used was faked see for example http folk uio no nathan web statement html where the scientist who produced the data used for one of the program s main arguments says we have reason to believe that parts of the graph were made up of fabricated data that were presented as genuine the inclusion of the artificial data is both misleading and pointless quo the quote reads a graph featured in the documentary titled temp solar activity 400 years firstly we have reason to believe that parts of the graph were made up of fabricated data that were presented as genuine the inclusion of the artificial data is both misleading and pointless http folk uio no nathan web statement html suggesting in fact that data used in the temp solar activity 400 years was faked not the data used in tggws i m not attempting to prove or disprove either theory as kim pointed out povs are not particularly relevant all i am attempting to suggest is that climate change as presented in this article is a theory and that alternative viewpoints are possibl re read again they are talking about the version of the graph in tggws only similarly the original temperature graph they used was s faked s adapted by the graphics team to a version that accidentally supported the argument of the movie unfortunately discussion forums and blogs are not reliable sources and pov isn t balanced by adding the extreme alternate view realclimate are already infamous for deleting legitimate questions that are inconvenient to their political position i could point you to usenet discussions to prove it yes we can always rely on usenet discussions to prove things i really didn t realise you all felt so

''Global Change'' refers to the large-scale environmental changes resulting from human impact during the (ongoing) process of the agricultural and industrial revolution.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”", "date": "0:36, 23 July 2009 (UTC)", "article": "34194757", "id": "263"}, {"parent_global_id": "263", "parent_author_name": "141.76.178.218", "thread": " redirection from GLOBAL CHANGE ", "level": "1", "timestamp": "20809868", "discussion": "0", "author": "46", "global_id": "264", "day": "3128", "parent_id": "263", "parent_author": "2370613978", "author_name": "Awickert", "text": ":This often happens when nobody has written the appropriate article yet; would you like t", "date": "8:08, 26 July 2009 (UTC)", "article": "34194757", "id": "264"}, {"parent_global_id": "264", "parent_author_name": "Awickert", "thread": " redirection from GLOBAL CHANGE ", "level": "2", "timestamp": "20818433", "discussion": "0", "author": "46", "global_id": "265", "day": "3134", "parent_id": "264", "parent_author": "46", "author_name": "Awickert", "text": "::I changed the redirect to a stub as per my talk, and using a definition from PB", "date": "6:53, 1 August 2009 (UTC)", "article": "34194757", "id": "265"}], "date_max": "2009-08-01", "revisions": [], "chains_num": 0, "tree_hindex": 1, "article_sections": [], "users_hindex": 1, "nb_messages": 3, "max_depth": 1, "match": 0, "users": ["141.76.178.218", "Awickert"]}, {"index": 56, "fulltext": " please retain this notice for at least 2 weeks to allow interested parties time to see it i feel that editors who are interested in global warming or climate change related articles may also be interested in participating in the following rfc http en wikipedia org wiki talk anthony_watts_ blogger rfc _how_should_this_page_be_disambiguated 3f rfc how should this page be disambiguated", "name": "Friendly Notice", "date_min": "2009-07-28", "chains_comments": 0, "nb_users": 1, "messages": [{"parent_global_id": "266", "parent_author_name": "0", "thread": " Friendly Notice ", "level": "0", "timestamp": "20812579", "discussion": "0", "author": "52", "global_id": "267", "day": "3130", "parent_id": "266", "parent_author": "0", "author_name": "GoRight", "text": "Please retain this notice for at least 2 weeks to allow interested parties time to see it.

A large region of highly statistically significant positive response is found over the equator between about 35â€“50 km, peaking at about 43 km with an amplitude of 1.75 K. This warming is present in all seasons and is therefore likely to be a direct radiative response to solar irradiance and UV absorption by ozone in this region during solar maxima.&lt;/blockquote&gt;   <LF>   :&lt;blockquote&gt;[2 paragraphs down] A negative temperature response to the solar cycle is found at high latitudes of both hemispheres. ... The anomalous meridional temperature gradient gives rise to a strong solar-induced zonal wind response in the upper stratosphere/lower mesosphere of both hemispheres (Fig. 3 ). These midlatitude features are predominantly a wintertime phenomenon associated with the strength of the polar night jet (Fig. 4 ). They are therefore likely to be due to indirect (dynamical) effects. Analysis of monthly responses suggests that it is the timing of the stratospheric winter warmings that is influenced by increases in solar cycle activity (Gray et al. 2004).&lt;/blockquote&gt;   <LF>   :I will change &quot;upper layers&quot; to stratosphere for the momen", "date": "7:30, 25 September 2009 (UTC)", "article": "34194757", "id": "277"}], "date_max": "2009-09-25", "revisions": [], "chains_num": 0, "tree_hindex": 1, "article_sections": [], "users_hindex": 1, "nb_messages": 2, "max_depth": 1, "match": 0, "users": ["William M.

Or so it seems. The British-based science watchdog, Number Watch, wondered just how many and went to the trouble of documenting them.   <LF>   It has kept on its Web site a near-comprehensive set of links to a long list of things attributed by either scientific research or the media to global warming. As you read it, some items will strike you as contradictory. Others, perhaps, as merely absurd. And still others as factually impossible.   <LF>   However they strike you, in perusing the list one thing will become clear: just how much the fear of global warming has come to taint both science and news reporting on the issue.   <LF>   Following is the list of phenomena (756 entries in all) linked at one time or another to warming. They range from acne, bubonic plague and a drop in circumcisions to Yellow fever, whale beachings, walrus stampedes, witchcraft executions and the threat of zebra mussels.   <LF>   Actual links to stories that make the claims listed below can be found at http://www.numberwatch.co.uk/warmlist.htm.

Few amphibians or reptiles are likely to follow shifting climates because most do not have the migratory prowess of other organisms such as birds, mammals, and many fishes (Parmesan, 2006). This leaves these   <LF>   groups subject to the changing climates with little time available for adaptation (Rahel et al.,1996). Some species have already succumbed to shifting climates (Pounds and Crump, 1994; Pounds et al., 1999; Pounds, 2006).Alteration of precipitation patterns due to climate change may influence many aspects of the biology of an organism. It may partly explain the demise of the golden toad (Pounds et al., 1999) and may drive amphibian disease epidemics such as chytrids (Pounds et al., 2006). The warming climate may even reduce the intensity of sexual selection, especially by influencing call parameters (Gerhardt and Mudry, 1980; Sullivan, 1982; Cocroft and Ryan, 1995).  It can reduce the overall abundance in anurans (Piha et al., 2007). Climate associated drought can drive population fluctuations by selecting against specific age classes of rainforest frogs (Stewart, 1995) and certainly would positively or negatively influence temperate species as well. In the case of the golden toad and the harlequin frog, the humid climate needed for survival migrated above the mountain leaving no acceptable habitat for these species (Pounds et al., 1994). Interactions between the increased drought and agriculture-induced landscape homogenization may lead to catastrophic species declines (Piha et al., 2007). Unfortunately, the complex relationships among climate variables and other stressors (Gunn et al., 2004) make it difficult to study their influence on amphibian life history and declines (Blaustein and Kiesecker, 2002; Davidson et al., 2002).  In the case of Box Turtles (McCallum et al. 2009) and Blanchard's Cricket Frog (McCallum 2010) the impacts of predicted climate change patterns in Arkansas are significant.  In the case of box turtles, the altered precipitation and temperature regimes would likely cause turtles to cease growth at body sizes too small to allow effective reproduction.  Further, Blanchard's Cricket Frogs should experience reduced reproductive investment leading to smaller eggs.  In both cases, population collapse would be the likely result.     <LF>   Citations:   <LF>   McCallum, M.L. 2010.

The original article uses  Deuterium levels as a proxy for global temperature, how the point of interest is that while the original article shows that the lag between carbon dioxide levels and global temperature is minimal and in some cases one leads the other. My point of concern is that the graph in the Wikipedia article on climate change shows that carbon dioxide levels rise well before (C. 1000 years) before temperature increases. This has implications with regards to which factor plays a greater role  in the casuation of the other.    <LF>   Given the disparity between the graphs in Nature magazine and the Wikipedia article, it is not possible that both graphs are accurate representations of the relationship between temperature and carbon dioxide levels.

However, if the third section had its examples moved elsewhere, it'd have a bunch of stubby sections, and overall I think we'd run out of space for images.  Technically one could have images sometimes on both sides, but I don't think that (and consequent uneven word wrapping) would look as good.   <LF>   * Especially if assuming a new reader, some of the examples are relatively helpful to getting an idea of the kinds of physical evidence left behind, suitable for being in close proximity.   <LF>   * The examples seem not always particularly linkable to a single cause (alone).

subsequent edits and at least one other editor likes my structural re arrangement http en wikipedia org wiki talk climate_change archive_3 causes_sub_section_lede its true i erroneously argued that volcanism should be internal however i was unwittingly basing that on an incomplete definition of the climate system one that simply listed lithosphere as part of the climate system it seems the lithospehere component is meant to refer to the surface and volcanism is specifically defined by ipcc as being an external forcer i learned that in the talk page discussion in this article i appreciate the fact you read my text thanks but i was dead wrong paragraphs towards the beginning hard to comment i don t know what you re referring to in general anytime one attempts to sort something out be it papers or misc hardware or text at a midpoint in the project my experience is that the big pile slowly turns into well organized piles with the leftovers still a bit jumbled up and the funny thing is the jumbled up small pile starts to stand out more since its side by side with tidy organization so instead of just jumbling it all up once again to hide the disarray you keep whittling away at the small pile of leftovers if there s some bizarrely located paragraph please help what i was trying to improve its been awhile if memory serves i thought the prior articles arrangement of text about different forcing mechanisms to look a bit like the rock type conglomerate lots of matrix and hunks of different size and density in no particular order in the current comments on the talk page someone complains that the article is emphasizing contemporary earth bound global warming its my understanding the article is supposed to be about climate change on any planetary body in any geologic period if that is the focus then that lends impetus for an organization based on internal or external forcing mechanisms in general if you have specific ideas go for it or just want to flag specific paragraphs that are a problem but aren t sure what to do about it probably neither am i since i left it that way you can always start a section in the talk page to call the attention of other editors working on this recently may i have your permission to move this entire subsection including your comment to the article s talk page maybe there s a way to un archive the thread i linked to early in this reply comment and if so i d add this the yep you may move all of this to the talk page of the article it d be more useful there what seemed strange to me about your new organization is that we have ocean variability sitting all by itself in a category is there anything else that could go in internal forcing mechanisms to make it less lonely i d be happy to chip away at it what in particular seemed less clear to me was the restructuring of the causes intro paragraph i thought the old one link above was fairly clear while the new one seems to wander quite a bit i think the radiative forcing beginning could be better explained and connected to the forcing mechanisms that are discussed in the article i hadn t realized that your talk page comments would be archived so quickly so i missed them unfortunately we ve been left with a mess because the climate folks decide to make their own definition of lithosphere see the wikipedia article for the dominant usage which is what geologists use what are we to do ignore the source or be inconsistent with the definition of the word i see you ve qualified it and i ll try to think of something as well well i think i have a better sense of what s going on now and i will take your permission to edit boldly and of course tell you that my feelings won t be hurt if you change my edits boldly and i think we will be able to make some improvement this is in reply to your statement that the climate folks decide to make their own definition of lithosphere at first i thought that too based on geology 101 in my undergrad further reading suggests vulcanism has its roots in the asthenosphere and not just the lithosphere armed with that info made me change my mind i now think those climate folks do have a technically correct point when they split the hairs that way if not its still more useful since vulcanism makes irregular spikes in the climate system as opposed to gradual day in day out type carbon cycle processes like forest biomass or permafrost uptake or outgassin volcanism has many sources but the melt generally is formed in the mantle and migrates up to the surface thereby involving the lithosphere and plate tectonics is entirely about the lithosphere i think i see what they are saying though they want to include interactions with the land surface anyway i m going to try to not get

Here are my edits, with a few improvements by P   <LF>   :*http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Climate_change&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=432158612&amp;oldid=431925555   <LF>   :*http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Climate_change&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=432347713&amp;oldid=432305679   <LF>   :*http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Climate_change&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=432573843&amp;oldid=432365027   <LF>   :Outline... I appreciate your comments and encourage you to refrain from wholesale revert, since there's been a lot of subsequent edits and at least one other editor likes my structural re arrangement [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Climate_change/Archive_3#Causes_sub_section_lede]];  Its true I erroneously argued that &quot;volcanism&quot; should be internal, however I was unwittingly basing that on an incomplete definition of the climate system, one that simply listed &quot;lithosphere&quot; as part of the climate system.  It seems the lithospehere component is meant to refer to the surface, and volcanism is specifically defined by IPCC as being an external forcer.  I learned that in the talk page discussion in this article.  I appreciate the fact you read my text (thanks!) but I was dead wrong.   <LF>   :Paragraphs towards the beginning....  hard to comment, I don't know what you're referring to.  In general, anytime one attempts to sort something out, be it papers or misc hardware or text, at a midpoint in the project my experience is that the big pile slowly turns into well organized piles with the leftovers still a bit jumbled up... and the funny thing is the jumbled up small pile starts to stand out more, since its side by side with tidy organization.  So instead of just jumbling it all up once again to hide the disarray, you keep whittling away at the small pile of leftovers.  If there's some bizarrely located paragraph, please  help!   <LF>   :What I was trying to improve...  its been awhile.  If memory serves, I thought the prior articles arrangement of text about different forcing mechanisms to look a bit like the rock type &quot;conglomerate&quot;.  Lots of matrix, and hunks of different size and density in no particular order.  In the current comments on the talk page, someone complains that the article is emphasizing contemporary Earth-bound global warming.  Its my understanding the article is supposed to be about climate change on any planetary body in any geologic period.  If that is the focus, then that lends impetus for an organization based on internal or external forcing mechanisms ''in general''.   <LF>   :If you have specific ideas go for it, or just want to flag specific paragraphs that are a problem but aren't sure what to do about it (probably, neither am I since I left it that way) you can always start a section in the Talk page to call the attention of other editors working on this recently.   <LF>   :May I have your permission to move this entire subsection (including your comment) to the article's talk page?
