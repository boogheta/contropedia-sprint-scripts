However, the maximum estimate of 70,000,000 bison [http://www.bisoncentral.com/history/history.asp] is less than the 97,000,000 cattle[http://www.nass.usda.gov:81/ipedb/] in the USA.

Robinson's lecture is very dodgy. 1. It is placed immediately after the sentence stating atmospheric concentration of CO2, suggesting that he is disputing measured CO2 concentrations, which he is not. 2. In the lecture he says that it's based on referenced, peer-reviewed science, but then goes on to make many value judgements which cannot be backed up by any peer-reviewed data. For an example, see Figure 9 in the presentation, which he says himself has no figures, is an approximation, and therefore holds no scientific merit until a full study is conducted to assess the credibility of the claims.

I see now that I cannot promote my own website, whether it's for commerical or other reasons. I do see however that personal webpages can be linked if written by a &quot;recognized authority&quot;, but that the writer should consider mentioning it on the talk page and let neutral and independent Wikipedia editors decide whether to add it. &quot;Recognized authority&quot; is of course a subjective matter. I certainly don't have the power to make decisions over climate change policy, but then I don't think that is a relevant criteria to use in this instance. I have worked as a climate change policy consultant however, where I was working on national and international climate change policy issues, so I do have experience of that working area (and much to critique it too).

A large region of highly statistically significant positive response is found over the equator between about 35–50 km, peaking at about 43 km with an amplitude of 1.75 K. This warming is present in all seasons and is therefore likely to be a direct radiative response to solar irradiance and UV absorption by ozone in this region during solar maxima.&lt;/blockquote&gt;   <LF>   :&lt;blockquote&gt;[2 paragraphs down] A negative temperature response to the solar cycle is found at high latitudes of both hemispheres. ... The anomalous meridional temperature gradient gives rise to a strong solar-induced zonal wind response in the upper stratosphere/lower mesosphere of both hemispheres (Fig. 3 ). These midlatitude features are predominantly a wintertime phenomenon associated with the strength of the polar night jet (Fig. 4 ). They are therefore likely to be due to indirect (dynamical) effects. Analysis of monthly responses suggests that it is the timing of the stratospheric winter warmings that is influenced by increases in solar cycle activity (Gray et al. 2004).&lt;/blockquote&gt;   <LF>   :I will change &quot;upper layers&quot; to stratosphere for the momen	 Solar stuff

Marland et all (2006), which now seems to be at [http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/emis/overview_2006.html], is used as a source for human emissions. We often use simply &quot;carbon&quot;, because the major carbon-containing emissions (CO, Methane, CO2) nearly all end up as CO2 in fairly short times. I'm very sure that the USGS is well aware of this and has taken it into account.  Note that they claim 30 billion tons of CO2, while Marland et al lists about 8 billion tons of Carbon, depending on the year [http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp030/global.1751_2006.ems]. 8 billion tons of carbon times 3.66 comes out at the 30 billion tons of CO2.

Or so it seems. The British-based science watchdog, Number Watch, wondered just how many and went to the trouble of documenting them.   <LF>   It has kept on its Web site a near-comprehensive set of links to a long list of things attributed by either scientific research or the media to global warming. As you read it, some items will strike you as contradictory. Others, perhaps, as merely absurd. And still others as factually impossible.   <LF>   However they strike you, in perusing the list one thing will become clear: just how much the fear of global warming has come to taint both science and news reporting on the issue.   <LF>   Following is the list of phenomena (756 entries in all) linked at one time or another to warming. They range from acne, bubonic plague and a drop in circumcisions to Yellow fever, whale beachings, walrus stampedes, witchcraft executions and the threat of zebra mussels.   <LF>   Actual links to stories that make the claims listed below can be found at http://www.numberwatch.co.uk/warmlist.htm.

Had the 1997 [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niňo]] lasted twice as long, the [[rain forest]]s of the [[Amazon basin]] and [[Southeast Asia]] could have quickly added much additional carbon dioxide to the air from burning and rotting, with heat waves and extreme weather quickly felt around the world (The &quot;[[Burn locally, crash globally]]&quot; scenario&lt;ref name=&quot;Calvin2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Calvin | first = William H.  | title = Global fever: How to treat climate change | year = 2008 | url = http://www.williamcalvin.org/bk14}}&lt;/ref&gt;).   <LF>   Most abrupt climate shifts, however, are likely due to sudden circulation shifts. The best-known examples are the several dozen shutdowns of the [[North Atlantic Ocean]]'s [[Shutdown of thermohaline circulation|Meridional Overturning Circulation]] during the last [[ice age]], affecting climate worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calvin2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises.|year=2004|author=Alley, Richard B, et al |journal=US National Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But there have been a series of less dramatic abrupt climate shifts since 1976, along with some near misses.   <LF>   The circulation shift in the western Pacific in the winter of 1976-1977&lt;ref&gt;(Miller AJ, Cayan DR, Barnett TP, Oberhuber JM (1994) The 1976-77 climate shift of the Pacific Ocean. Oceanography 7: 21–26. http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~miller/papers/shift.html)&lt;/ref&gt; proved to have much wider impacts. Since 1950, El Niňos had been weak and short, but La Niňas were often big and long, This pattern reversed after 1977. Land temperatures had remained relatively trendless from 1950 to 1976, despite the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rising from 310 to 332 ppm as [[fossil fuel]] emissions tripled. Then in 1977 there was a marked shift in observed global-mean surface temperature to a rising fever on land at about 2°C/century.   <LF>   The expansion of the tropics from overheating is usually thought to be gradual, but the percentage of the land surface in the two most extreme classifications of [[drought]] suddenly doubled in 1982 and stayed there until 1997 when it jumped to triple (after six years, it stepped down to double). While their inception correlates with the particularly large El Niňos of 1982 and 1997, the global drought steps far outlast the 13-month durations of those El Niňos.   <LF>   In addition to near-misses for Burn Locally, Crash Globally in 1998, 2005, and 2007, there have also been two occasions when the Atlantic's Meridional Overturning Circulation lost a crucial safety factor. The [[Greenland Sea]] flushing at 75&amp;nbsp;°N shut down in 1978, recovering over the next decade. While shutdowns overlapping in time have not been seen during the fifty years of observation, previous total shutdowns had severe worldwide climate consequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calvin2008&quot; /&gt;   <LF>	Gradual push, sudden shift

Few amphibians or reptiles are likely to follow shifting climates because most do not have the migratory prowess of other organisms such as birds, mammals, and many fishes (Parmesan, 2006). This leaves these   <LF>   groups subject to the changing climates with little time available for adaptation (Rahel et al.,1996). Some species have already succumbed to shifting climates (Pounds and Crump, 1994; Pounds et al., 1999; Pounds, 2006).Alteration of precipitation patterns due to climate change may influence many aspects of the biology of an organism. It may partly explain the demise of the golden toad (Pounds et al., 1999) and may drive amphibian disease epidemics such as chytrids (Pounds et al., 2006). The warming climate may even reduce the intensity of sexual selection, especially by influencing call parameters (Gerhardt and Mudry, 1980; Sullivan, 1982; Cocroft and Ryan, 1995).  It can reduce the overall abundance in anurans (Piha et al., 2007). Climate associated drought can drive population fluctuations by selecting against specific age classes of rainforest frogs (Stewart, 1995) and certainly would positively or negatively influence temperate species as well. In the case of the golden toad and the harlequin frog, the humid climate needed for survival migrated above the mountain leaving no acceptable habitat for these species (Pounds et al., 1994). Interactions between the increased drought and agriculture-induced landscape homogenization may lead to catastrophic species declines (Piha et al., 2007). Unfortunately, the complex relationships among climate variables and other stressors (Gunn et al., 2004) make it difficult to study their influence on amphibian life history and declines (Blaustein and Kiesecker, 2002; Davidson et al., 2002).  In the case of Box Turtles (McCallum et al. 2009) and Blanchard's Cricket Frog (McCallum 2010) the impacts of predicted climate change patterns in Arkansas are significant.  In the case of box turtles, the altered precipitation and temperature regimes would likely cause turtles to cease growth at body sizes too small to allow effective reproduction.  Further, Blanchard's Cricket Frogs should experience reduced reproductive investment leading to smaller eggs.  In both cases, population collapse would be the likely result.     <LF>   Citations:   <LF>   McCallum, M.L. 2010.

On the one hand, it describes internal variability as involving changes in the interactions between the five components of earth's climate system, and one of those components is the place where the volcanos live, e.g., the lithosphere.   On the other hand, it describes volcanos as an external forcing mechanism.    I'll eventually look for peer review references to help clarify this (minor?) point, though I expect we'll find inconsistency there too.

Volcanoes are an external forcing, but changes in the lithosphere are part of the long term internal variability (e.g. rock weathering). There probably is some effect on volcanism due to climate over very long time scales, but for most purposes, volcanism counts as external (as it's not part of the climate). In the IPCC glossary I cited, under Lithosphere: {{cquote|Volcanic activity, although part of the lithosphere, is not considered as part of the climate system, but acts as an external forcing factor.}}   <LF>   : The same is true for plate tectonics.   <LF>   :The Global Climate Change website you cited seems to be using a different definition for internal and external variability, with the latter being apparently restricted to only forcings completely outside the Earth.

One of these is that the timing of spring events has come earlier and earlier each year.  Plant and animal ranges have moved upwards and toward the poles due to the increasing temperature.  The warmer climate has increased the water temperatures as well.  The evidence for this is that there have been shifts in the ranges of algae, plankton and fish as well as changes in their abundance.   <LF>   Causes   <LF>   	Concentrations of CO2 and methane in the atmosphere are much higher than the natural range during the last 650,000 years.  The high CO2 concentrations are mainly due to fossil fuel use although land-use change also contributes a small part.  The methane concentrations are not only due to fossil fuel use but also due to agriculture.  If environmental policies concerning CO2 and methane emissions don’t improve the climate will continue to get warmer year after year.   <LF>   	The solar forces and volcanic forces over the last 50 years would have produced cooling according to climate models which don’t include human activity.  Since the opposite is what is actually happening, models that include anthropogenic forcings are much more realistic.  Human’s emissions of pollutants and green house gasses into the atmosphere are mostly to blame for the warming of our climate.  Changes in even wind patterns (effecting tropical storm tracks and temperature patterns) can be traced back to these anthropogenic forcings.   <LF>   Projected Changes   <LF>   	Between the years 2000 and 2030 green house gas emissions are expected to increase anywhere between 25% and 90%.  Without any policy changes, the average temperature is expected to increase 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade for the next two decades.  The warming will be highest over land and in northern latitudes.  The warmer weather might also increase the spread of infectious diseases which normally are kept at bay by winter weather.  Without the cold weather there to kill them, the infectious organisms and carriers could thrive.  Extreme weather (tropical storms, etc.) will become more frequent and more destructive with the increasing temperature.  The high CO2 levels in the atmosphere will lead to an acidification of the ocean. This could put marine organisms at risk of biological consequences.   <LF>   Sources   <LF>   IPCC Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report   <LF>   Science Museum of the National Academy of Sciences, http://www.koshland-science-museum.org/exhibitgcc/index.jsp   <LF>   http://www.grida.no/publications/climate-in-peril/page/3545.aspx   <LF>   http://www.cbmjournal.com/content/1/1/2   <LF>   &lt;!-- End request --&gt;   <LF>	 Edit request from Ksinha42, 11 July 2011

While all of them deal with the [[Alvarez hypothesis]], none mentioned climate, and even less the role of the impact as a climate forcing. I think you are somewhat confused. A large-scale asteroid impact can initiate climate change, but it is not, in itself, a (significant) forcing. The initial forcing is mostly due to changes in effective albedo caused dust and soot, with longer term effects caused by changes in greenhouse gases as the result of large fires and disruptions to the biosphere.

Wikipedia itself mentions that the effects of an extinction level asteroid would remain for &quot;years,&quot; not that it would cause a change in the climate.  I imagine that depends on whether the asteroid/comet triggers other &quot;feedbacks&quot; that push the climate beyond &quot;tipping points&quot; - if such feedback loops and tipping points exist (which I imagine they do if the damage/change is large enough).

Most organisms don't care about the climate, as the species readily adapt, in most cases and, with evolution, constantly change over time. In some cases, lifeforms may do better with climate change, not worse. The only ones who care about climate change are humans, and they care mostly for selfish reasons, as they only care about how climate change affects them, and mostly the planet will adapt to pretty much anything you throw at it. That has been the constant history of this planet and will continue to be.   <LF>   Most scientists, when polled, as well as most people in general, agreed that climate change is one of the least important problems facing humans, not the most, contrary to what some say. Only humans care, the rest of the planet will find it mostly uninteresting or irrelevant, since the climates are always changing, sometimes radically so.   <LF>   I want to edit the page and add in History of Climate Changes, but the article has been locked because too many people at my University have been editing Wikipedia articles.

It also clearly presents the science against the AGW theory and IPCC conclusions as bunk and has incredibly bigoted conclusions within the article. Totally preposterous, totally non-objective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   <LF>   :For example, &quot;Many of the largely settled scientific issues, such as the human responsibility for global warming, remain the subject of politically or economically motivated attempts to downplay, dismiss or deny them – an ideological phenomenon categorised (sic) by academics and scientists as climate change denial.&quot; Where there actually was a sentence in the same paragraph that at least alludes to studies funded to produce desired results by 'both sides', it then continues to just slam the oil industry and provides no examples to the lobbyists on the other side. This continues within other sections as well. Most sections read like a FAQ of a pro-AGW site that provides what one could say are talking points without any consideration of the scientific argument against that talking point. It has graphs that are all the depict the same pro-AGW studies, it has silly picture depictions such as this one (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:97%25_of_Climate_Scientists_Confirm_Anthroprogenic_Global_Warming.svg). Another example can be seen obviously within the section on 'Arctic shrinkage' presents an opinion, from 2007 (when the the Arctic had a low-level of observed ice extent, relative to a small timeframe as goes most of this 'conclusive' data). However, what is the controversy? One would not know, given this section's pro-AGW content sans any other data/research. Whereas, one can find, from the same source (NISDC website) recent data that depicts the Arctic ice extent has grown in size, as of October 2013 (where the Arctic summer had just ended and data had been recently collected). This may be relative to post-2006/7; however, the point of much of this recent data from the late 70s (which was under a cooling trend) is that it does not conclude anything other than data relative to recent past data. Decades before, centuries before (of course, hundreds of thousands of years before) where previous cooling and warming trends sparred back and forth would have to be considered as well to claim any valid conclusion on Arctic ice extents being impacted by AGW or human influence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   <LF>   :What is even more laughable (although, really this is in all seriousness, NOT funny) is that there is a 'False balance' article that is grossly biased as well. Gee, it also has a section specifically for 'Global Warming', how convenient. For example: The article ironically libels scientists '''-as 'skeptics' who are concluded to be not equal to the pro-AGW scientists-''' who have done studies and written papers that result in contrary conclusions to those scientists who have done studies and written papers resulting in a promotion of the theory of AGW (&quot;This paragraph puts scientists against skeptics, as though both are on equal grounds of knowledge, when in reality the scientists (even in 1992) have far more reason to believe that humanity is causing temperatures to rise than skeptics have to disagree.&quot;/&quot;Giving equal voice to scientists on both sides makes it seem like there is a debate within the scientific community, even though there is a scientific consensus.&quot;). The article also marginalizes the controversy by equating it to disputes between atheists and creationists. Which likens it to something backed by many scientific studies vs. something that has a total lack of scientific studies to back it (as creationists back their theory on faith, perhaps one could say -for the record, in order to avoid being profiled by provinical folks  of both sides who read this, I am not religious -yet, there is a 1/infinity chance for anything to be possible within perceived reality, as such, both atheists and creationists should take note). This is not flat-earth theory, there are MANY scientists and MANY studies (and no they are not funded by Exxon, just as not all pro-AGW is funded by the 'green' industry) and they need to be objectively represented. If there are 100 studies for pro-AGW, and there are only 50 for the contrary, then fine...but, all scientific studies must be presented. If Exxon funded one, if the 'Green' industry funds another, then mention that. Also, mention the methods, if controversial and contradicted by other studies. All should be treated objectively. It's not a contest, where one side could fund twice as many as the other then claim that they have more science (and biased media outlets/what people call &quot;journalism&quot;) on their side so, therefore, all is settled -resulting in the push to ignore/censor or libel any scientific evidence the other side has. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   <LF>   :'''In other words, wiki articles and some of their citations provide a [[Shell_corporation|Shell corporation]] of 'reliable sources''''   <LF>   :	 Why isn't this article (and the 'Global Warming' article) subject to the infamous wiki banner: &quot;The neutrality of this article is disputed.&quot;?

Further, according to the IPCC wiki itself, &quot;The IPCC does not carry out its own original research, nor does it do the work of monitoring climate or related phenomena itself.

There are a large number of peer reviewed scientific papers that identify correlation with climate change to &quot;solar forcing&quot;. The debate might then be described as to what extent recent human activity has, or has not, overridden solar forcing. Therefore to assert &quot;there are no credible alternatives&quot; is overstating the case.

If you look at the 65 year tend of arctic temperatures, the trend is negative.  I am concern the unsophisticated reader, say a young student doing a paper on climate change, could look at this and conclude that global warming is still debatable.  I prefer the &quot;global mean temperatures&quot; example because it more explicitly shows the true nature of global warming.  I realize that is not the primary purpose of this section, but given the amount of misinformation being propagated by moneyed interests about current climate change, I think it helps if Wikipedia can be explicit about the true nature of current climate change whenever possible.
